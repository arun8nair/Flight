move bg backwards
endless bg spawning
delete bg once behind
bg till horizon
player bounds
obstacle spawning
obstacle hitting ends game
game over message in ui
stop spawning course on game over 

slight tilt on maneuvring - 
	- figure out rotation in unity
	- revisit the project design document
	slerp the rotation
	cap rotation at 60
		- slerping and capping with angular vel
		- quaternion.lookrotation
		- rb.MoveRotation
		- transform.rotate

	bring the plane back to its original rotation after 
	prevent snapping to opp extreme on change in direction - set slerp factor

tilt feature
	smoothen - currently jittery
	tilt back to og pos on mouse up - how?
		- mouse down enables tilt, on mouse up, tilt back
		- in mobile, have two inputs, one for tilt, one for movement
	clicking on different part of screen snaps object to different rotation
dont spawn obstacles for first few tiles
different types of obstacles

fix movement jitter
slightly rotate along the y axis also


fix the snapping of plane tilt to different position on mouse click
after manual tilt, auto tilt does not work

refactor code and rename improper variables
tilt controls restriction
	- tilting in a direction: reduce sensitivity and add some delay/drag(response has to lag a bit)
add game design to obstacles, increase difficulty
	- replace obstacles with real assets
	- vertical moving balloon, 
	- sideways moving blimp, 
	- stationary buildings, 
	- rotating cranes
	- birds moving in z axis 
		- flock of birds move in v shape
		- birds animation needs to be desyncd
		- flock needs velocity

speed up player gradually
	- use same prefab for empty track and other
	- calc and adjust the course generation accordingly
	- instantiate track and increase speed at same time


add background (parallax effect?)
	- add different kinds of buildings
	- spawn more buildings without overlap
modify collider to fit the plane
replace primitives
snapping back to og pos on clicking while tilted - sometimes

Game UI
	- styling
	- Restart 
procedural building generation or randomized generation
	- better textures or low poly versions of current buildings
tighten the obstacles gap
improve obstacle spawning distance and look
	- add fog/fade in obstacles


add a building obstacle at center of road
rotate propeller
add offset to the bird obstacles
Cap the speed at max value
IMPT!! fill the gaps between track pieces

add road, move road down
increase size of buildings so that only 1 building per track piece reqd
change camera angle to improve perspective

building colors 
	- add colors to skyscrapers next
birds need to move!!!!
	- if player reaches within a min distance of birds, they may move randomly
	- halo/force field effect around birds to improve visibility
collision matrix for obstacles
player physics / plane reacts to hitting obstacles
adjust the probabilities of some obstacles - building
Sound effects and music
Score and high score

make player move a certain distance, instead of continuous movement
collectibles
shaders or styling
Mobile Version ( without tilt input/add tilt input)
Options button in menu
add cloud - clouds contain powerup
Make code and editor more readable
	- gameobjects in the scene can be seperated into sections
	- descriptions for public fields
if user stays in one place for too long, spawn an obstacle there
layer culling can be used to make track invisible
crane obstacle in under construction areas
improve init speed or course speed change value
improve game over response ui
give controls UI help
change inputs to serialize field privates
store the high score
dither fade?
controls lag

CORRECT TRACK GAPS
SCORE COLOR
HIGH SCORE
VELOCITY adjustment
DECREASE BLIMP SPEED
SKYSCRAPER COLORS
ADAPTIVE PERFORMANCE SETTINGS

?I am a game programmer who is transitioning
into game development from web development. 
This website showcases some of my personal
projects and games that I have built. I am 
passionate about creating engaging and 
immersive experiences for players. If you 
are interested in working with me, please 
feel free to contact me through the contact 
page.Here, you will find a collection of my
works, ranging from 2D platformers to 3D first
-person shooters. I am always looking for new 
ideas and challenges, so if you have a project
in mind, let's discuss it!
